# Semgrep Demo Cheatsheet

**Quick reference for your 5-minute demo presentation.**

---

## üîß Setup Commands (Run Before Demo)

```bash
cd /home/partoa/work/CodeQL
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## üé¨ Demo Commands (In Order)

### 1. Initial Scan (Show 11 Vulnerabilities)

```bash
semgrep --config=semgrep-rules.yaml vulnerable_app.py
```

**Expected output**: 11 findings in beautiful colored format

---

### 2. Show Custom Rules File

```bash
cat semgrep-rules.yaml
```

**Talking points**: 
- YAML format (easy!)
- Pattern looks like actual code
- Metavariables like `$VAR`
- Detailed remediation messages

---

### 3. Show Vulnerable Code

```bash
cat vulnerable_app.py
```

**Point out**:
- Line 20: SQL injection
- Line 27: Command injection
- Line 9-11: Hardcoded secrets

---

### 4. Semgrep Playground Demo

**URL**: https://semgrep.dev/playground

**Left Panel** (paste this rule):
```yaml
rules:
  - id: sql-injection-demo
    pattern: db.execute(f"... {$VAR} ...")
    message: SQL injection found!
    severity: ERROR
    languages: [python]
```

**Middle Panel** (paste this code):
```python
query = request.args.get('q')
db.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{query}'")
```

**Right Panel**: Shows match highlighted in real-time! ‚ú®

---

### 5. Advanced Pattern (Optional)

**Show taint tracking capability:**

```yaml
mode: taint
pattern-sources:
  - pattern: request.args.get(...)
pattern-sinks:
  - pattern: db.execute(...)
```

**Talking point**: "This traces user input through the entire application, just like CodeQL!"

---

### 6. JSON Output (Optional - for CI/CD discussion)

```bash
semgrep --config=semgrep-rules.yaml vulnerable_app.py --json | jq '.results | length'
```

**Output**: 11

**Talking point**: "Perfect for CI/CD pipelines and automated security gates"

---

## üéØ Key Talking Points

### Why Semgrep?

1. **Fast**: 11 findings in 2 seconds
2. **Easy**: Rules in YAML, not complex query language
3. **Local**: No cloud service needed
4. **Visual**: Playground shows matches in real-time
5. **Powerful**: Taint tracking, auto-fix, CI integration

### vs CodeQL

| Feature | CodeQL | Semgrep |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Setup | 30+ min | 30 sec |
| Rules | QL (hard) | YAML (easy) |
| Speed | Minutes | Seconds |
| Platform | GitHub | Independent |

## üìä Vulnerabilities to Highlight

### Critical (emphasize these 3)

1. **SQL Injection** (Line 20)
   - Shows f-string interpolation danger
   - Easy to exploit: `?q=' OR '1'='1`

2. **Command Injection** (Line 27)
   - Direct `os.system()` call
   - Attack: `?cmd=rm -rf /`

3. **Hardcoded Secrets** (Lines 9-11)
   - OpenAI API key: `sk-...`
   - GitHub token: `ghp_...`
   - Shows pattern matching power
